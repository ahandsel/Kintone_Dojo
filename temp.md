@Masato Ito 

### Day02 Review:

### Day01 Review:
https://github.com/masatonaut/Kintone_Dojo_3/issues/7#issue-640956758

### Note:
Since you have already merged your develop branch with master branch, I was unable to make a Pull Request.
Thus I submitted my reviews as GitHub Issues for Day01, Day02, and Day03.

For Day04, please create a develop branch from master branch and save your Day04 files there only.

Once you are ready for my review, please create a Pull Request.

Please refer to my README.md
